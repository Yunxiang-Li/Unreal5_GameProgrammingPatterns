# Singleton Pattern:

## Summary

The **Singleton pattern** ensures that only **one instance** of a class exists at any given time. It is commonly used for managers or global systems that need to persist across different game levels. However, its misuse often leads to tight coupling and reliance on global state, making the code harder to maintain and extend. While the concept is straightforward, its implementation and practical use often introduce design challenges.

## Concept

The core idea of the Singleton pattern is to restrict instantiation to a single object. A private static variable holds the instance, and an accessor method ensures controlled access. This approach is useful when managing global systems, such as a game manager that needs to persist across levels while preventing multiple instances from being created.

However, the common mistake in Singleton implementation is exposing a public static variable, which leads to tight couplingâ€”allowing multiple classes to directly reference and depend on it. A better approach is to let a manager handle its initialization and distribute the reference using dependency injection, ensuring controlled access while reducing unintended dependencies.

## Limitations

While the Singleton pattern solves the issue of multiple instantiations, it comes with several drawbacks:

- **Encourages Global State**: Making the Singleton globally accessible often leads to unintended dependencies, making code harder to refactor and test.
- **Hinders Dependency Management**: Many implementations expose the instance directly, causing excessive coupling between classes.
- **Reduces Flexibility**: Unlike dependency injection, which allows flexible initialization, the Singleton pattern enforces a rigid structure, making code less adaptable to changes.
- **Alternative Design Patterns Often Work Better**: Many Singleton use cases can be replaced with dependency injection, component-based aggregation, or subclass sandboxing, leading to more modular and scalable designs.

While the Singleton pattern is useful in certain situations, it is frequently misused. Alternatives like dependency injection are often preferable, as they offer greater control over dependencies and reduce unintended coupling.
